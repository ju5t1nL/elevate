# Data Sharing

## Data Sharing Challenges

- Data sensitivity
- Organising data in a presentable, shareable & useful way
- Accidental disclosure of confidential or personal information
- Deliberate disclosure of data by a bad actor
- Violation of intellectual property rights
- Loss of control over data
- Costs of sharing data
- Misuse of data for unauthorised purposes

## Data Sharing Agreement

- What data can be shared?
- What uses can be made of data?
- Where and how data can be shared?
- Who has authority to access data?
- What outputs are permitted to be produced?
- The agreement should address concerns about release of the data, or any outputs produced from it to the public or third parties.
